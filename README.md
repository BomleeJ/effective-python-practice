# Effective Python: Summer 2025 Learning Repository

This repository documents my learning journey as I read **Effective Python** by Brett Slatkin during the summer of 2025.

## Purpose

- Deepen my understanding of Python through practical examples and projects.
- Apply the book’s insights to build small projects and scripts.
- Track my progress and growth as a Python developer.
- Learn to use Git and GitHub effectively in the process.

## Structure

Each chapter may contain:
- Summary notes
- Code snippets
- Mini-projects or experiments
- Reflections on what I’ve learned

## Why This Matters

This is both a technical learning exercise and a version control practice repo. I'm using it to build habits, sharpen my skills, and explore Python more deeply with real applications.

## Acknowledgments

Based on _Effective Python (2nd Edition)_ by Brett Slatkin.
